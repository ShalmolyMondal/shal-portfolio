# Project Portfolio

## [PROJECT 1: Data generation for IoT applications based on situations](https://github.com/ShalmolyMondal/SA-IoTDG)

**Problem:** As the number of IoT applications across diverse sectors like manufacturing and healthcare explodes, so does the demand for effective testing and analysis of the platforms hosting them. While proven methods exist for traditional databases and large-scale data environments, existing tools fall short of evaluating IoT-specific middleware due to the inherent complexity and heterogeneity of IoT applications and their data.

**Solution:** We developed SA-IoTDG, a novel, situation-aware IoT data generation framework specifically designed for the performance evaluation of IoT middleware platforms. Recognizing that most IoT applications are event or situation-driven, SA-IoTDG leverages a situation-based approach to generate situation-specific data that accurately reflects the application's requirements.

### Benefits:

* **Researchers and developers**: Generate realistic IoT data for initial testing and performance evaluation of their applications before real-world deployment.
* **Reduced risk and cost:** Identify potential performance bottlenecks and issues in the chosen middleware platform early on, saving time and resources.
* **Improved application quality:** Optimize and refine IoT applications based on data-driven insights from performance evaluations.

## [PROJECT 2: Bicycle Lane Detection](https://github.com/ShalmolyMondal/bicycle-lane-detector)

* Developed a model to detect bicycle lane markings on the road to improve cyclist safety.
* Implemented image classification for various types of road markings to optimize detection accuracy.
* Annotated the images, and applied image augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
* After thorough research, adopted the YOLOv5 model for effective bicycle lane detection.


##  [PROJECT 3: Activity Classifiation]

* Created a tool that classifies the activities of factory workers in a meat processing plant
* Built a client-facing API using flask.
